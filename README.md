# CS 325 - Analysis of Algorithms
## Oregon State University

This repository contains my work for CS 325 - Analysis of Algorithms, offered at Oregon State University. The course focuses on algorithm design, analysis, and implementation in Python.

### Course Information
- **Office Hours:** [Schedule and Locations]
- **Textbooks:** 
  - Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)
  - Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos (KT)
  - Algorithms Illuminated by Roughgarden (R)
  - Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani (DPV)
  - Algorithms Etc. by Jeff Erickson (E)

### Course Objectives
- Learn important algorithms and their implementations in Python.
- Develop basic algorithm analysis skills (such as time complexity).
- Prepare for industrial interviews with top firms (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon).
- Transition from conventional C++/Java programming to Python.
- Prepare for ACM International Collegiate Programming Contests (ICPC).
- Train to think like a computer scientist: recursively, abstractly, and rigorously.

### Topics Covered
1. **Python Tutorial & Basic Data Structures**
   - Sorting and Selection: Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort, Priority Queues, Hashing.
2. **Basic Complexity Analysis**
   - Master equation, recursion tree method, amortization.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
4. **Graph Algorithms**
   - BFS/DFS, topological sort, Dijkstra, Viterbi, Prim, Kruskal, TSP.
5. **NP-Completeness**
